## CS 224W, Pytorch-LightGCN

This github repository is an adaptation of the LightGCN implementation (SIGIR 2020 https://github.com/gusye1234/LightGCN-PyTorch). 
We show a variation of the LightGCN implementation using pytorch geometric with message passing for user to course recommendations.

The github repository contains the original implementation of LightGCN along with the Pytorch Geometric implemented version for effective comparison between the two implementations.
